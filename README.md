# docker_port_finder
# Docker Port Finder  **Docker Port Finder** is a Python script designed to identify Docker containers that are listening on a specified port. The script outputs the container ID and container name if the port is being used by any running container. If no container is listening on the specified port, the script informs the user accordingly.
